- 👋 Hi, I’m Sheree or @luxsheree. I'm an esthetician, artist, and mother. I'm new to developing but I'm hopeful to learn more from a creative team.   
- 👀 I’m interested in a multitude of areas, but I'm mostly passionate about art and scientific incorporation. This is a basic repository for projects or tools I find useful. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about AI and product management. I have a deep love for science and all of its beautiful branches. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making advancements to society in any ways I can. Finding quality mentor/partnerships is of high priority!   
- 📫 You can reach me on IG: @xosheree Check out my art! IG: @ultravioletdollhouse
