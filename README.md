<h1>👋 Hi! I'm Sheree or @luxsheree</h1>

<b>This is a repository for projects or tools I find useful.</b> 

- 👽 I'm an aesthetician, artist, and mother. I'm new to developing but I've always had a love for technology and AI.  
- 💥 I’m interested in a multitude of areas, but I'm mostly passionate about art and scientific incorporation.  
- 🔮 I’m currently learning as much as I can about AI and project management. Can't wait to learn more from a creative team.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making advancements to society in creative ways. Finding mentor/partnerships is of high priority!
